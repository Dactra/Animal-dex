It is found around the central and northern parts of Afghanistan.  This mountain dog shares similar genetic background to the Central Asian Ovtcharka (CAO).\nBecause the dog is intricately associated with nomad life in remote and rugged regions where Western breeding techniques are not used, it is difficult to identify a \"true\" Kuchi type dog.  Warfare and general unrest in the region has also affected the Kuchi people, of whom many have settled around cities, creating ample opportunity for the Kuchi to interbreed with other dogs.

There are two separate varieties of Akita: a Japanese strain, commonly called \"Akita Inu\" (\"inu\" means \"dog\" in Japanese), or \"Japanese Akita\"; and an American strain, known as the \"Akita\" or \"American Akita\". The Japanese strain comes in a narrow palette of colors, with all other colors considered atypical of the breed, while the American strain comes in all dog colors. The Akita has a short double-coat similar to that of many other northern spitz breeds such as the Siberian Husky, but long-coated dogs can be found in many litters due to a recessive gene.\nThe Akita is a powerful, independent and dominant breed, commonly aloof with strangers but affectionate with family members. As a breed, Akitas are generally hardy, but they have been known to be susceptible to various genetic conditions and can be sensitive to certain drugs.\nIn all countries except the United States, the Japanese and American strains of Akita are considered two separate breeds. In the United States, however, the two strains are considered a single breed with differences in type. For a while, the American strain of Akita was known in some countries as the \"Great Japanese Dog\".

None of the purebred northern breeds can match it for sheer racing speed. Sprint-racing events such as the Fairbanks, Alaska Open North American Championship and the Anchorage Fur Rendezvous are invariably won by teams of Alaskan huskies, or Alaskans crossed with hounds or gun dogs. Hounds are valued for their speed and endurance.

Inevitably these mountain dogs filtered through to the wider population, and the original variety dwindled in its pure form, though a rare breed, the \"Cane Garouf\" or \"Patua\", found in the part of the Alps formerly inhabited by the Alpine Mastiff, may also descend from the extinct breed.\nThe Alpine Mastiff was, along with the Tibetan Mastiff and Caucasian Shepherd Dog, one of the earliest breeds of dog to reach truly gigantic size.

It is a spaniel type dog that is closely related to the English Cocker Spaniel; the two breeds diverged during the 20th century due to differing breed standards in America and the UK. In the United States, the breed is usually called the Cocker Spaniel, while elsewhere in the world, it is called the American Cocker Spaniel in order to differentiate between it and its English cousin, which was already known as \"Cocker Spaniel\" before the American variety was created. The word cocker is commonly held to stem from their use to hunt woodcock in England, while spaniel is thought to be derived from the type's origins in Spain.\nThe first spaniel in America came across with the Mayflower in 1620, but it was not until 1878 that the first Cocker Spaniel was registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC). A national breed club was set up three years later and the dog considered to be the father of the modern breed, Ch. Obo II, was born around this time. By the 1920s the English and American varieties of Cocker had become noticeably different and in 1946 the AKC recognised the English type as a separate breed. It was not until 1970 that The Kennel Club in the UK recognised the American Cocker Spaniel as being separate from the English type. The American Cocker was the most popular breed in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s and again during the 1980s, reigning for a total of 18 years. They have also won the best in show title at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show on four occasions, and have been linked to the President of the United States on several occasions, with owners including Richard Nixon and Harry S. Truman.  In 2013, the cocker spaniel ranked 29th the American Kennel Club registration statistics of historical comparisons and notable trends.\nThe breed is the smallest of the sporting dogs recognised by the AKC, and its distinctly shaped head makes it immediately recognisable. In addition, there are some marked differences between it and its English relative. It is a happy breed with average working intelligence, although by being bred to a show standard it is no longer an ideal working dog.

The English Coonhound has a high prey drive and, while it is typically used in 'coon hunting', it is also skilled in treeing.

This breed is a medium-sized, short-coated dog that occurs in two main colour forms. It has either brown or black hair distributed fairly evenly through a white coat, which gives the appearance of a \"red\" or \"blue\" dog.\nAs with dogs from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is energetic and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, particularly if it is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.\nIn the 19th century, New South Wales cattle farmer Thomas Hall crossed the dogs used by drovers in his parents' home county, Northumberland, with dingoes he had tamed. The resulting dogs were known as Halls Heelers. After Hall's death in 1870, the dogs became available beyond the Hall family and their associates.

Robert Kaleski, who wrote the first standard for the breed, was influential in its development.\nAustralian Cattle Dog has been nicknamed a \"Red Heeler\" or \"Blue Heeler\" on the basis of its colouring and practice of moving reluctant cattle by nipping at their heels.

They became known to the general public through rodeos, horse shows, and Disney movies made for television.\nFor many years, Aussies have been valued by stockmen for their versatility and trainability. While they continue to work as stock dogs and compete in herding trials, they have earned recognition in other roles due to their trainability and eagerness to please and are highly regarded for their skills in obedience. Like all working breeds, Aussies have considerable energy and drive and usually need a job to keep them occupied. They often excel at dog sports such as dog agility and frisbee and are also highly successful as search and rescue dogs, disaster dogs, detection dogs, guide dogs, service dogs, and therapy dogs.

The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale places the breed in its group five (spitz and primitive types), and the United Kennel Club (US) places the breed in its Sighthound and pariah group.\nThe Basenji produces an unusual yodel-like sound (commonly called a \"baroo\"), due to its unusually shaped larynx. This trait also gives the Basenji the nickname \"barkless dog\".\n\nBasenjis share many unique traits with pariah dog types. Basenjis, like dingoes, New Guinea singing dogs and some other breeds of dog, come into estrus only once annually\u2014as compared to other dog breeds, which may have two or more breeding seasons every year. Both dingoes and Basenji lack a distinctive odor, and are prone to howls, yodels, and other vocalizations over the characteristic bark of modern dog breeds. One theory holds that the latter trait is the result of selecting against dogs that frequently bark\u2014in the traditional Central African context\u2014because barking could lead enemies to humans' forest encampments. While dogs that resemble the Basenji in some respects are commonplace over much of Africa, the breed's original foundation stock came from the old growth forest regions of the Congo Basin, where its structure and type were fixed by adaptation to its habitat, as well as use (primarily net hunting in extremely dense old-growth forest vegetation).\nThe name comes from the Lingala language of the Congo, mbw\u00e1 na bas\u025b\u0301nzi which means 'villager dogs'.\n\n","image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/c\/c5\/Basenji_Profile_%28loosercrop%29.jpg"},{"breed":"Basque Shepherd Dog","summary":"The Basque Shepherd Dog is a landrace breed of dog originating in the Basque Country and traditionally used by the local shepherds to help them take care of their cattle and sheep.

The foxhounds that traveled with them were not small enough to do the Border terrier's job.\nIn 2006, the Border Terrier ranked 81st in number of registrations by the AKC, while it ranked 10th in the United Kingdom.In 2008, the Border Terrier ranked 8th in number of registrations by the UK Kennel Club.\nThey are originally used for hunting in packs as they were exceptionally good at catching rabbits and any small animal. Now they are commonly seen as family pets.\n\n","image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/70\/Border_Terrier.jpg"},{"breed":"Borzoi","summary":"The borzoi (, literally \"fast\"), also called the Russian wolfhound (Russian: \u0420\u0443\u0301\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0431\u043e\u0440\u0437\u0430\u044f, romanized: Russkaya psovaya borzaya), is a breed of domestic dog. Descended from dogs brought to Russia from central Asian countries, it is similar in shape to a greyhound, and is also a member of the sighthound family.\nThe system by which Russians over the ages named their sighthounds was a series of descriptive terms, not actual names. Borz\u00f3i is the masculine singular form of an archaic Russian adjective that means \"fast\". Borz\u00e1ya sob\u00e1ka (\"fast dog\") is the basic term used by Russians, though sob\u00e1ka is usually dropped. The name psovaya derived from the word psovina, which means \"wavy, silky coat\", just as hortaya (as in hortaya borzaya) means shorthaired. In modern Russian, the breed commonly called the borzoi is officially known as russkaya psovaya borzaya. Other Russian sighthound breeds are stepnaya borzaya (from the steppe), called stepnoi; and krimskaya borzaya (from the Crimea), called krimskoi.\nThe most commonly used plural form is the regular formation borzois, which is the only plural cited in most dictionaries. However, the Borzoi Club of America and the Borzoi Club UK both prefer borzoi as the form for both singular and plural forms.","image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/de\/Chart_rosyjski_borzoj_rybnik-kamien_pl.jpg"},{"breed":"Barak hound","summary":"The Barak or Bosnian Broken-haired Hound (Bosnian: Bosanski o\u0161trodlaki goni\u010d), is a hunting dog breed developed in Bosnia.

The breed is generally friendly, affectionate and good with both children and other animals; however,  they require a lot of human interaction. Since they are family dogs, it is recommended to not leave one alone for long periods at a time. The expected average lifespan of a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is under ten years.The Cavalier King Charles changed dramatically in the late 17th century, when it was interbred with flat-nosed breeds. Until the 1920s, the Cavalier shared the same history as the smaller King Charles Spaniel. Breeders attempted to recreate what they considered to be the original configuration of the breed, a dog resembling Charles II's King Charles Spaniel of the Restoration. Various health issues affect this particular breed.","image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/5f\/CarterBIS.Tiki.13.6.09.jpg"},{"breed":"Celtic Hounds","summary":"The Celtic hounds were a breed of dogs in Gaelic Ireland described in Irish legend.

Gris de Saint-Louis (Grey St. Louis Hound) was a breed of dog, now extinct, which originated in Medieval times. Like the Chien de Saint-Hubert it was a scenthound, and formed part of the royal packs of France, which were composed, from about 1250 till 1470, exclusively of hounds of this type. According to King Charles IX, (1550\u20131574) they supposedly were introduced to France through Saint Louis (i.e. King Louis IX, 1226\u20131270), who had encountered these hounds while a prisoner during the Crusades, and subsequently received some as a gift. Old writers on hunting liked to ascribe an ancient and remote origin to their hounds, and these were claimed to be originally from Tartary. \nThey were large, and, even though they did not have such good noses, were preferred by the Kings to the St Huberts, which were said to be only of medium size.\nJacques du Fouilloux, in the 16th century, says they were common, and describes them as 'gris' (grey) on the back with forequarters and legs tan or red, some having near black hair on the back. They were roughhaired, and were ancestors of the  modern French rough-coated Griffon breeds. However the rough coats were not mentioned by Charles IX or du Fouilloux, and it has been suggested they were acquired later through interbreeding with indigenous French hounds.  They were headstrong, wide casting hounds, inclined to change or overshoot, but determined in their pursuit of a quarry to the death. However, by the nineteenth century, like the St Hubert, they had become virtually impossible to find, because of mixed breeding and the effect of the Revolution on French hunting.George Turberville   translated du Fouilloux' book on hunting into English, and used the term 'Dun hound' to translate 'Chien-gris'. We may presume he did not translate it literally as 'grey-hound' to avoid confusion. One finds the term 'dun-hound' in some subsequent writing in English, suggesting that the kind also existed in Britain, and it has been supposed that these 'dun-hounds' went into the make up of the Bloodhound, accounting for the 'badgering' of the hair in the saddles of some bloodhounds.  However, Turberville did not make it very clear that his book was a translation, and it is highly possible that people mistakenly believed his work was about English hunting. Early references to the dun-hound may simply come from people relying, like Nicolas Cox, on Turberville, [1] and it is quite possible that the dun hound was never a significant animal in British hunting.","image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/71\/Gris_De_Saint-Louis_from_1915.JPG"},{"breed":"Chihuahua (dog)","summary":"The Chihuahua  (listen) (Spanish: chihuahue\u00f1o) is the smallest breed of dog, and is named after the Mexican state of Chihuahua.

The species name is debated: it is variously called Canis familiaris, Canis familiaris dingo,  Canis lupus dingo, or Canis dingo. It is either a purebred, if breeding only in the wild, or a hybrid of a dingo and a domesticated dog. It is a medium-sized canid that possesses a lean, hardy body adapted for speed, agility, and stamina. The dingo's three main coat colours are: light ginger or tan, black and tan, or creamy white. The skull, the widest part of the dingo, is wedge-shaped and large in proportion to the body. It differs from that of the domestic dog by its larger palatal width, longer rostrum, shorter skull height, and wider sagittal crest.The earliest known dingo fossil, found in Western Australia, dates to 3,450 years ago, which led to the presumption that dingoes came to Australia with seafarers prior to that time. Dingo morphology has not changed over the past 3,500 years: this suggests that no artificial selection has been applied over this period.The dingo is closely related to the New Guinea singing dog: their lineage split early from the lineage that led to today's domestic dogs, and can be traced back through the Malay Archipelago to Asia. A recent genetic study shows that the lineage of those dingoes found today in the northwestern part of the Australian continent split from the lineage of the New Guinea singing dog and southeastern dingo 6,300 BC, followed by a split between the New Guinea singing dog lineage from the southeastern dingo lineage 5,800 BC. The study proposes that two dingo migrations occurred when sea levels were lower and Australia and New Guinea formed one landmass named Sahul that existed until 6,500\u20138,000 years ago. Seafarers from south-west Sulawesi in modern-day Indonesia may have brought the dingo to northern Australia.The dingo's habitat covers most of Australia, but they are completely absent in the southwest, a strip on the eastern coast, and an area on the southwest coast (see map). Dingos prey on mammals up to the size of the large red kangaroo, in addition to birds, reptiles, fish, crabs, frogs, insects, and seeds. The dingo's competitors include the native quoll, the introduced European red fox and the feral cat. A dingo pack usually consists of a mated pair, their offspring from the current year, and sometimes offspring from the previous year.The first British colonists who settled at Port Jackson in 1788 recorded dingoes living with indigenous Australians. When livestock farming began expanding across Australia in the early 19th century, dingos began preying on sheep and cattle. Numerous population-control measures have been implemented since then, with only limited success. The dingo is recognised as a native animal under the laws of all Australian jurisdictions.

It is sometimes called the Irish Glen of Imaal Terrier or the Wicklow Terrier, and the name of the breed is often shortened by fanciers to just Glen.\nThe breed originates in, and is named for, the Glen of Imaal in County Wicklow, Ireland. It was recognised first by the Irish Kennel Club in 1934 and most recently by the American Kennel Club in 2004. The Canadian Kennel Club voted to fully recognize Glens in 2017 after the breed spent years on the Miscellaneous list; approval by Agriculture Canada is pending.\nReportedly, the Glen's history began during the reign of Elizabeth I, who hired French and Hessian mercenaries to put down a rebellion in Ireland. After the conflict, many of these soldiers settled in the Wicklow area. They brought with them their low-slung hounds, which they bred with the local terrier stock, eventually developing a distinctive breed that became known as the Glen of Imaal Terrier.\nGlens were originally used for eradicating other animals such as rat, fox, badger, and otter, and also as a general-purpose farm dog for herding and family companionship. Unlike many other terriers, they are \"strong dogs\" rather than \"sounders\"\u2014they were bred to work mute to ground, going silently into dens after their quarry rather than barking at it to alert their handlers. In hunting trials, which used to be required by many kennel clubs for championships, Glens were disqualified if they sounded at the quarry. For this reason, today they are among the quietest terriers.\nAccording to Irish lore, Glen of Imaal Terriers were also used as turnspit dogs to turn meat over fires for cooking. Evidence for this is scarce, and engravings of such dogs from the 19th century do not bear much resemblance to today's Glen. It is, however, repeated in many descriptions of the breed and often used in color commentary by dog show announcers.\nThe breed almost died out before being revived in the early twentieth century by breeders in its homeland. Today, the Glen of Imaal Terrier is still one of the rarest breeds of dog (in the US, living registered animals number in the hundreds) and the least-known Irish terrier breed. It is considered a vulnerable native breed by the UK's Kennel Club, which tracks breeds in which fewer than 300 puppies are registered each year.[1]\n\n","image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/fe\/Wheaten_glen_of_imaal.jpg"},{"breed":"Golden Retriever","summary":"The Golden Retriever is a large-sized gun dog that retrieve shot waterfowl, such as ducks and upland game birds, during hunting and shooting parties.

The confusion arises from the fact that both breeds belong to the Spitz family, along with the Elk-Hound, German Spitz, Samoyed, Finnish Spitz, and many others.\nThe Indian Spitz was introduced in India by the British who began breeding them from a stock of German Spitzes. Years of breeding produced the ideal dog type which was suited to the plains of India and was capable of withstanding India's sultry climate.

Members of the breed were owned by Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia.\nThe King Charles Spaniel and the other types of toy spaniels were crossbred with the Pug in the early 19th century to reduce the size of the nose, as was the style of the day. The 20th century saw attempts to restore lines of King Charles Spaniels to the breed of Charles II's time. These included the unsuccessful Toy Trawler Spaniel and the now popular Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. The Cavalier is slightly larger, with a flat head and a longer nose, while the King Charles is smaller, with a domed head and a flat face.\nHistorically the breeds that were merged into the King Charles Spaniel were used for hunting; due to their stature they were not well suited.

The Koolie is a working or herding dog which has existed in Australia since the early 19th century when it was bred from imported British working dogs. Robert Kaleski, in an article on Cattle Dogs in the August 1903 issue of the Agricultural Gazette of New South Wales, describes the \"Welsh heeler or merle, erroneously known as the German collie,\" as a \"blue-gray dog about the size and build of a smooth-haired collie, generally with wall eyes.\"  The British background predominated in the dogs that came to be associated with the \"German collie\" name.\nThere is substantial variation in the Koolie population, as Koolies were bred to exhibit different characteristics in different regions. The Koolie Club of Australia defines the breed based on its ability to work rather than on its conformation. However, most Koolie breeders refer to the Koolie as a breed rather than as a type, and assert that it \"breeds true\", with various types or strains.\nThe Koolie is a 'herding dog', one which has a natural instinct to cast out (i.e., circle widely), round sheep and bring them back to their owner. Koolies are known as silent, upright, working dogs. They are used for \"herding\" sheep and also for quiet careful work at close quarters at lambing time or for \"shedding\" (cutting out) sheep.","image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/e\/ef\/Pete_may01_web.JPG"},{"breed":"Koyun dog","summary":"The Koyun dog is a flock and herd guardian dog of Molosser type.

The Moscow Water Dog was produced only by the Red Star Kennels, the state-operated organization chartered to provide working dogs for the armed services of the Soviet Union.\nAfter World War II, there were very few working dogs in Soviet Union as many had been killed during the war. Some were imported but there were not enough to establish a dedicated breeding programme for a specific breed. The Central Military School of Working Dogs (the Red Star Kennels), under the command of Colonel G. P. Medvedev began working on developing a number of their own specialised breeds by crossing the available stock. A few breeds were established including the Moscow Newfoundland, a cross of German Shepherd Dog and Newfoundland; the Moscow Great Dane, using German Shepherd and Great Dane; the Brudasty Hound, which was an Airedale Terrier and Russian Hound mix; the Moscow Watchdog, a combination of St. Bernard and Caucasian Shepherd Dog; and the Moscow Water Dog.  The most successful breed to come out of the programme was the Black Russian Terrier, which gained international recognition in 1984; it derived from a combination of 14 different breeds including the Moscow Water Dog in the later stages of its development.\nMoscow Water Dogs were bred in Krasnaya Zvezda, Belarus, by interbreeding Newfoundland males with East European Shepherd and Caucasian Shepherd Dog females, and by mating the offspring with each other. They were developed as a water rescue\/lifesaving dog, but according to O. Krasnovskaya, \"That was not a good idea as [they] were not willing to save drowning people, but mostly were looking to bite them, so this breed was never developed\".","image":"https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/24848110\/33519396-7e56363c-d79d-11e7-969b-09782f5ccbab.png"},{"breed":"Mountain Cur","summary":"The Mountain Cur is a type of working dog that is bred specifically for treeing and trailing small game, like squirrel and raccoons.

The exact date of its extinction is not known; it is likely that it was gradually interbred with other breeds, particularly the modern Beagle, until the genuine North Country Beagle bloodline ceased to exist.\nThe origins of the North Country Beagle are equally unclear. Most writers suggest that it was developed from the Talbot, whose origins are also uncertain, but which some have claimed originated in Normandy. The Talbot was a predominantly white, slow, deep-throated, scent hound. At some point the Talbots were crossed with Greyhounds to give them an extra turn of speed, but they remained comparatively slow dogs that relied more on their nose than speed in the chase.The North Country Beagle was a large, bony hound with a square head, and long trailing ears. Chiefly bred in Yorkshire, it was common in the north of England, but below the River Trent the similar Southern Hound was more abundant. The North Country Beagle was a faster dog; in The British Encyclopedia of 1809, William Nicholson says that the North Country Beagle was kept by the \"dashing class of sportsman\" because it could \"run down a brace [of hare] before dinner\", but although a good scent hound, was probably lacking in this ability when compared to the delicate nose of the Southern Hound. The writer and poet Gervase Markham, who wrote a number of books on animal husbandry in the early 17th century described the North Country Beagle as having:\n\n...a head more slender, with a longer nose, ears and flews more shallow, back broad, belly gaunt, joints long, tail small, and his general form more slender and greyhound-like...\nIn his The Dog, in Health and Disease in 1859, \"Stonehenge\" (the pen name of John Henry Walsh, later editor of The Field) says the two breeds could be differentiated by the large dewlap possessed by the Southern Hound. The Southern Hound seems to have also had a deeper more melodious voice; Markham says the North Country Beagle had \"only a little shrill sweetness\" and lacked depth of tone. How far the Talbot, Northern Hound and Southern Hound were intermixed by the 19th century is impossible to ascertain: while acknowledging that they had once existed as separate breeds, Stonehenge had never seen pure-bred varieties and classified the three breeds together.Both the North Country Beagle and Southern Hound seem to have fallen out of favour during the 18th century as the fashion for less time consuming hunts led to the development of the faster Foxhound. The North Country Beagle may have formed part of the packs kept by southern farmers for rabbit-hunting that would eventually become the nucleus for the modern Beagle breed. Stonehenge says that packs of hounds that resembled the description of the North Country Beagle still existed in Wales, Devon, Yorkshire and Sussex during the 19th century, but he was doubtful as to how far any of these packs truly represented any of the three early hound breeds.Aside from the Beagle other modern hound breeds are believed to have North Country Beagle blood: Harriers and Foxhounds among others. Coonhounds and Bloodhounds are likely to have had more influence from the Southern Hound and Talbot lines, as they are excellent trackers but not as swift as other hound breeds.","image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/6\/6b\/Beagle_%28PSF%29.png"},{"breed":"Northern Inuit Dog","summary":"The Northern Inuit Dog is a crossbred dog that originated in the late 1980s, in an attempt to create a domestic dog breed more closely resembling the wolf.

It is one more confirmation of the mechanism behind the extinction of sighthound varieties, where the loss of \"aristocratic\", landed hunting rights (pursued mainly by horse, and hound) gave place to \"universal\", licensed hunting rights (pursued mainly on foot, by gun) which tended to literally outlaw sighthounds. Sighthounds, which by definition require large open tracts of land, became an object of suspected poaching, and were often actively persecuted. Consequently the regional and national varieties, which for ages had been prolific across Europe, were eradicated or allowed to die out. The Chort, Magyar Agar and Chart, for example escaped this fate, the Frisian sighthound did not. Where national breed and Kennel Clubs actively encouraged sighthound studbooks, and where a strong coursing culture was present sighthounds such as the Galgo survived. In some cases, as with the latter, and as Bauer and Lemo report in connection with the hrt, regional sighthound identity could be compromised by crosses to Greyhounds or other breeds.","image":"https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/24848110\/33519396-7e56363c-d79d-11e7-969b-09782f5ccbab.png"},{"breed":"Old Danish Pointer","summary":"The Old Danish Pointer is a medium-sized  breed of dog, white with brown markings, originally used as a pointing dog in Denmark.\n\n","image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/1\/15\/Wy%C5%BCe%C5%82_du%C5%84ski_123.jpg"},{"breed":"Old English Bulldog","summary":"The Old English Bulldog is an extinct breed of dog.","image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/0a\/CribandRosa1811.jpg"},{"breed":"Old English Sheepdog","summary":"The Old English Sheepdog (OES) is a large breed of dog that emerged in England from early types of herding dog.

The Pandikona is named after the location where it is found. Pandikona is located near Kurnool district in Andhra Pradesh. The area is considered dangerous to outsiders because of warring factions and political differences. This highly territorial breed is used to guard villages, property and livestock and to hunt any available game. Their territorial nature and sharp tempers often result in fights with neighboring dogs that trespass onto its territory. Since Pandikona is a small village with overlapping property boundaries and most homes has 2 to 3 dogs, it is quite natural for dogs to posture and get into occasional squabbles over borders. Most of the squabbles end in one dog retreating and no serious injuries. Villagers do not normally intercede in the dogs territorial battles. These intelligent and independent dog are never chained but roam freely among the village and do not take directions from their owners. They are normally within the vicinity of their property and take their guarding duties seriously. When bored or satisfied with the security of their owners home the dogs will go to the owners farm and continue guarding duties. Ideally suited for guarding or hunting duties the Pandikona is a fierce protector that is tolerant of errant children and young strays but are deadly serious with adults. The Pandikona will normally warn the intruder to stay away but the warning is fleeting and the impending attack carried out swiftly and with great intensity. Adult Pandikona dogs are focused and confident in their abilities to defend and will exercise some judgment when confronted with a young person or juvenile animal. Their hunting function is performed in the traditional way with weapons that have been used for generations. Normally done with a spear or \"ballem\" which is a sharp metal end affixed to a stick. Hunting in this way exposes the hunter and the dogs to grave danger from boars and other animals. The dogs hunt in packs with a leaders established by pack order and all territorial disagreements are forgotten during the hunt. Typically the leader has the best nose and bite and goes in hunt for the boar with the pack following at a discrete distance. It is said that the pack has a complex communication system which enables the leader to warn the pack of dangers such as snakes, scorpions and if it has found the quarry. If the prey is very large the leader will take the first bite and bring the prey down. If the prey is not very challenging the leader will allow the junior leader to take the first bite and bring the quarry down with the other joining in the kill. \nPups join the hunt between 6 and 8 months of age.","image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/38\/Pandikona_Dog.jpg"},{"breed":"Paisley Terrier","summary":"The Paisley Terrier was a breed of terrier-type dog that is now extinct.

However, popular belief holds that this breed is descended from the Tesem, one of the ancient Egyptian hunting dogs based on the similarities between the breed and well documented images of dogs and descriptive writings found on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs. This line of thought hinges on the supposition that the Tesem, as the progenitor of the Kelb tal Fenek, was brought by the Phoenicians to Malta, where it has been carefully bred for over 2,000 years.  Dogs quite similar to the Pharaoh Hound and other possible Tesem descended dog breeds are found scattered around the Mediterranean where the Phoenicians traded, namely the Cirneco dell'Etna, Podenco Ibicenco, Podenco Canario, Podenco andaluz and the Portuguese Podengo.

It was a scenthound used in a pack to run down and kill game, or bring it to bay. The word appears before the Norman Conquest. It was sometimes confused with 'brache', (also 'bratchet') which is a French derived word for a female scent hound.In medieval hunting in England and Northern Europe, pursuit of the hart or wild boar involved using a 'limer' or 'lyam hound' (a hound handled on a leash or 'lyam') to trace the animal from its footprints or droppings to where it was browsing or lying up. This became known as 'harbouring' the animal. When this had been done, the huntsman reported back to his lord, who then brought the pack of raches to chase it down on its hot scent when it had been unharboured, 'rowsed' or 'upreared'. Sometimes, pairs of raches were held at strategic points along where the quarry was expected to run, to be uncoupled when the huntsman blew the signal, or when the quarry was seen to come close. The Bloodhound was typically used as a limer, and the raches were normally smaller hounds. A lord's pack would include one or two limers to about twenty or more raches.\n\nA king or lord would want to hunt a great stag, a 'hart of ten', or 'warrantable' stag, or a powerful boar, partly for the extra fat it carried when in prime condition in the hunting season, but mostly for kudos.\nIn Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Bloodhounds announce the presence of a great boar hiding in a thicket, which then rushes out and plays havoc among the raches of the knight's pack.\n\nNot all game was hunted using the leashhound. Dame Juliana Berners, writing in The Book of Saint Albans (1486) writes (translation): \n'My dear sons, I will now teach each one of you how many kinds of beasts must be upreared with the limer in wood or in fields - both the hart and the buck and the boar so wild. All other animals which are hunted must be sought and found with free-running raches (\"ratches so fre\").'\n\nOther writers might include the hare, bear, or wolf among animals to be harboured with the limer, but clearly raches could be hunted simply as a pack, as in modern hunting, if chasing 'lesser' game.\nAfter c. 1530 the term 'rache' was hardly used in England, 'running hound' (tr. of chien courant), or mostly just 'hound', being preferred, but the term was still used for a while in Scotland, where the Bloodhound was called the sleuth hound.  Hector Boece (1536) describes the rache in Scotland as a versatile scenthound, able to find flesh, fowl, or even fish among the rocks, by smelling. His translator, Bellenden, says that it is not a large as the sleuth hound. The picture below, though it did not appear in Boece's original, was first published to illustrate his account when it was summarised in Conrad Gessner's Historiae Animalium (Zurich 1554, in Latin).\n\nObviously raches must have far outnumbered Bloodhounds in the medieval dog population, and may have been quite disparate, depending on the sort of game they were used to hunt. In the picture above from Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry (1410) the raches are not all of the same breed. In Britain, they may have included the now-extinct North Country Beagle and Southern Hound. As styles of hunting changed, and the Bloodhound fell out of use, packs were normally employed on their own to hunt all quarry. Though their name became obsolete, raches must have continued in this use. We may assume that it was from them, rather than the Bloodhound, that the various breeds of pack hounds such as the English Foxhound, Harrier, Beagle and English Staghound were developed. It is apparent that in the 16th and 17th centuries there was a good deal of regional variation in size and type of scenthound, from which the prospective Master of Hounds could mix and match to form his pack.","image":"https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/24848110\/33519396-7e56363c-d79d-11e7-969b-09782f5ccbab.png"},{"breed":"Rafeiro do Alentejo","summary":"The Rafeiro do Alentejo, Alentejo Mastiff or Portuguese Mastiff, is a large breed of dog that originated in Portugal.

It is principally a white-bodied, rough-coated breed, developed in the mid to late 19th century by Captain John Edwardes at Sealyham House, Pembrokeshire.\nFollowing the First World War, it surged in popularity and was associated with Hollywood stars and members of the British Royal Family. Its numbers have dropped significantly since then, with the breed listed as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club; an all-time low was recorded in 2008 when only 43 puppies were registered in the United Kingdom. This decline has been blamed on an influx of foreign and designer breeds, and the Sealyham's reduced usefulness as a working dog.\nThis breed is equally suitable as a family dog or a working terrier, given the right training. It is affected by few breed specific breed disorders, with the only two prevalent conditions being lens luxation and canine degenerative myelopathy.  A DNA test is now readily available to identify dogs who carry the gene that causes lens luxation and breeding programs can be adjusted.","image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/0\/0a\/Charmin_crufts_2009.jpg"},{"breed":"Segugio Italiano","summary":"The Segugio Italiano (also known as Italian Hound or Italian Bloodhound)  [se\u02c8\u0261ud\u0292o ita\u02c8ljano] is an Italian breed of dog of the scenthound family.

The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is the younger of the two Corgi breeds and is a separate and distinct breed from the Cardigan. The corgi is one of the smallest dogs in the Herding Group. Pembroke Welsh Corgis are famous as the preferred breed of Queen Elizabeth II, who has owned more than 30 during her reign. Although these dogs have been favoured by British royalty for more than seventy years, among the British public they have recently fallen into decline in terms of popularity and demand. However, they remain very popular in the United States, where cities such as New York, Boston, and Los Angeles hold annual \"Corgi Meetups,\" in which hundreds of dogs and their owners congregate to spend the day.\nThe Pembroke Welsh Corgi has been ranked 11th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, which states that it is considered an excellent working dog.\nAccording to the American Kennel Club, Pembroke Welsh Corgis were ranked 20th most popular breed of dog in 2015.","image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/fb\/Welchcorgipembroke.JPG"},{"breed":"Welsh Hillman","summary":"The Welsh Hillman was an ancient landrace or type of herding dog in Wales, used for herding and droving. The variety is thought to have become extinct around 1990.\nThe Welsh Hillman was thought to have been descended from ancient Welsh herding dogs. It was possibly the oldest Welsh sheepdog, and may have been the descendant of the old gellgi or \"Welsh wolfhounds\" used around 1,000 years ago. Some sources, without any obvious evidence, suggest it was crossbred with similar dogs seen in North Africa.It was a large but rangy dog, up to around 25 inches in height, and described as \"fast and fearless\", with an appearance not unlike a lighter-built German Shepherd. The ears were pricked. The coat was usually of a light fawn, sandy or red-gold colour with a black saddle, white chest, white on the legs and tip of the tail and a blaze on the face. Blue merle dogs were also occasionally seen.\nThe breed was uncommon in modern times. C. L. B. Hubbard, writing in 1948, described it as \"almost extinct\" and \"scarcely ever seen working today\". The last known Welsh Hillman, \"Jess\", was purchased in 1974 from a hill farm near Hay-on-Wye by the author and broadcaster Jeanine McMullen, and was spayed before her owner realised her rarity.","image":"https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/24848110\/33519396-7e56363c-d79d-11e7-969b-09782f5ccbab.png"},{"breed":"Welsh Sheepdog","summary":"The Welsh Sheepdog (Welsh: Ci Defaid Cymreig, pronounced [ki\u02d0 \u02c8d\u025bva\u026ad k\u0259m\u02c8r\u025b\u0268\u0261]) is a landrace of herding dog from Wales. Some people incorrectly call a Welsh Sheepdog a Welsh Collie - usually 'Welsh Collie' is used for a cross between a Welsh Sheepdog and a Border Collie, who is often a milder dog and easier to manage than the pure breed.\nLike other types of working dog, Welsh Sheepdogs are normally bred for their herding abilities rather than appearance, and so they are generally somewhat variable in build, colour and size.  Welsh Sheepdogs are of collie type, usually black-and-white, red-and-white or tricolour, and merle markings may occur over any of these combinations.  The coat may be short or fairly long, and the ears are pricked, but usually folded at the tip.  They are longer in leg, broader in chest and wider in muzzle than the Border Collie. They are extremely active and intelligent, and therefore need much exercise and mental stimulation, if they are to be kept as pets.\nOver many decades the Welsh Sheepdog has largely been replaced for working sheep in Wales by the Border Collie, a standardised breed. However, in more recent years, efforts have been made to maintain the indigenous Welsh Sheepdog as a distinct variety.\nWelsh Sheepdogs are usually of loose-eyed action, not fixing the stock with their gaze like the strong-eyed Border Collie.  They are able to work independently without necessarily being under direct human control.  Welsh Sheepdogs are most often used for herding sheep, but also readily work cattle, goats, and even horses and pigs.  Traditionally they were often used as droving dogs to take cattle and sheep to markets locally or elsewhere in Britain.\nThe Welsh Sheepdog's life span is 12\u201315 years.","image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/85\/Welsh_Sheepdog.jpg"},{"breed":"Welsh Springer Spaniel","summary":"The Welsh Springer Spaniel (Cymraeg: Llamgi Cymru) is a breed of dog and a member of the spaniel family. Thought to be comparable to the old Land Spaniel, they are similar to the English Springer Spaniel and historically have been referred to as both the Welsh Spaniel and the Welsh Cocker Spaniel. They were relatively unknown until a succession of victories in dog trials by the breed increased its popularity. Following recognition by The Kennel Club in 1902, the breed gained the modern name of Welsh Springer Spaniel. The breed's coat only comes in a single colour combination of white with red markings, usually in a piebald pattern. Loyal and affectionate, they can become very attached to family members and are wary of strangers. Health conditions are limited to those common among many breeds of dog, although they are affected more than average by hip dysplasia and some eye conditions. They are a working dog, bred for hunting, and while not as rare as some varieties of spaniel, they are rarer than the more widely known English Springer Spaniel with which they are sometimes confused.","image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/ab\/Welsh_Springer_Spaniel_1.jpg"},{"breed":"Welsh Terrier","summary":"The Welsh Terrier (Welsh: Daeargi Cymreig) originates from Wales and was originally bred for hunting fox, rodents and badger, but during the last century it has mainly been bred for showing.

It is a medium-sized terrier, although with longer legs than other Scottish breeds of terrier. It has a white double coat of fur which fills out the dog's face, giving it a rounded appearance. \nThe breed is intelligent, quick to learn, and can be good with children, but does not always tolerate rough handling. The Westie is an active and intelligent breed, and is social with a high prey drive, as they were once used to hunt rodents. Additionally, it is a hypoallergenic dog breed.The modern breed is descended from a number of breeding programs of white terriers in Scotland before the 20th century. Cousin to the Cairn Terrier, the Westie was bred to hunt small rodents at places such as farms. Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of Poltalloch, is credited with the creation of the modern breed from his Poltalloch Terrier, but did not want to be known as such. \nOther related breeds included George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll's Roseneath Terrier and Dr Americ Edwin Flaxman's Pittenweem Terriers. This breed of small white Scottish terriers was given its modern name for the first time in 1908, with recognition by major kennel clubs occurring around the same time.\nThe breed remains very popular in the UK, with multiple wins at Cruft's. It is in the top third of all breeds in the US since the 1960s. It has been featured in television and film, including in Hamish Macbeth, and in advertising by companies such as Cesar dog food and Scotch whisky Black & White. \nSeveral breed-specific and nonspecific health issues appear in the breed, including a condition in young dogs nicknamed \"westie jaw\" which causes an overgrowth of bone in the jaw of the dog. It can also be prone to skin disorders, with a breed-specific condition called hyperplastic dermatosis occurring.

Russian publications indicate that the term West Siberian Laika loosely applied to hunting dogs originating with the Mansi and Khanty people in Ural and West Siberia, but there were no standards or registrations of WSL as such until 1930. Then WWll disrupted it for a while, but systematic breeding with registrations resumed after the war ended, in 1946. This was the time the breed began taking modern shape.  Before that hunters only knew of Mansi Laika and Khanty Laika. In early 1960 many hunters in Ural still preferred the term Mansi Laika, when speaking of West Siberian Laika. In Russian language, the term Laika originated from the word layat that means to bark. The word Laika simply means barker.

Part of the Hound group, Whippets have relatively few health problems other than arrhythmia. Whippets also participate in dog sports such as lure coursing, agility, and flyball. The name is derived from an early 17th-century word, now obsolete, meaning \"to move briskly\".There has been continuity in describing Greyhound-types of different sizes: large, medium and small, as recorded in hunting manuals and works on natural history from the Middle Ages. Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York confirmed in his early 15th century translation and additions to the original late 14th century French Livre_de_chasse the advantage of maintaining the great, the middle, and the small size of greyhound for different sorts of game.[1]\nThe English physician and academic John Caius refers in his 16th century De Canibus Britannicus to lesser as well as greater sorts of Leporarius, Grehounde (greyhound)pp9-10 and notably to a type which has been connected to the Whippet, the Tumbler, a lesser sort of mungrell Greyhounde and excellent warren dog for catching rabbits pp11-12, also recorded by the early 19th century Scottish curator and editor Thomas Brown (naturalist) [2]. The Victorian English writers describe the emerging modern breed of Whippet or snap-dog bred for catching rabbits, coursing competitions, straight rag-racing, and for the novel show fancy pp45-8, pp255-8\nThis has led to Whippets being described as \"the poor man's racehorse\".
