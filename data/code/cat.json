Such a breed may be recognized by one of the smaller cat registries. Smaller registries include the Rare and Exotic Feline Registry (REFR), the Dwarf Cat Association (TDCA), and others.  This list only includes breeds recognized by at least one extant, national or international, multi-breed registry.\nBreeders of some minority breeds actively seek major recognition for them, but have yet to receive it. For example, in regions where the formal cat fancy is in its infancy, naturally occurring native varieties \u2013 landraces \u2013 can be classified as minority breeds when attempts at selective breeding have begun to produce a formal natural breed with consistent traits, as is ongoing with the Aegean and Van cats. Other minority breeds are bred for private reasons and inadvertently attract an informal following. Minority breeds may be recognized by some registries, or none at all; recognition can be refused for a variety of reasons (including over-similarity to an existing breed, medical problems being statistically linked to the breed, and others). Some may have \"preliminary\" status in one or more registries, with experimental conformation standards already in place, but turn out to be non-viable over the longer term.\nDiscrepancies between breed names can often cause confusion; occasionally the name adopted by one registry is used elsewhere for an entirely different breed; for example, the breed known in Australia as \"Burmilla Longhair\" is analogous to the \"Asian Semi-longhair\" in Britain (also called the \"Tiffanie\"), but Australia already has a quite different breed known as the \"Australian Tiffanie\" and both are different from the American \"Tiffany\" (also known as the Chantilly-Tiffany).

The Exotic is similar to the Persian in many ways, including temperament and conformation, a flat nose and face with the exceptions of the short dense coat.In the late 1950s, the Persian was used as an outcross by some American Shorthair breeders. This was done in secret in order to improve their body type, and crosses were also made with the Russian Blue and the Burmese. The crossbreed look gained recognition in the show ring, but unhappy American Shorthair breeders successfully produced a new breed standard that would disqualify American Shorthairs that showed signs of crossbreeding. One American Shorthair breeder who saw the potential of the Persian\/American Shorthair cross proposed and eventually got the Cat Fanciers' Association judge and American Shorthair breeder Jane Martinke to recognize them as a new breed in 1966, under the name Exotic Shorthair. In 1987, the Cat Fanciers' Association closed the Exotic to shorthair outcrosses, leaving Persian as the only allowable outcross breed. \nBecause of the regular use of Persian as outcrosses, some Exotics may carry a copy of the recessive longhair gene. When two such cats mate, there is a 1 in 4 chance of each offspring being longhaired. Longhaired Exotics are not considered Persians by the Cat Fanciers' Association, although The International Cat Association accepts them as Persians.

Siamese tend to seek human interaction and also like companionship from other cats.\nThe Siamese (sometimes in the traditional form) is among the foundation stock of several other breeds developed by crossbreeding with other cats; some examples are the Oriental Shorthair and Colourpoint Shorthair, developed to expand the range of coat patterns; the long-haired variant most often dubbed the Himalayan; and hair-mutation breeds including the Cornish Rex, Sphynx, Peterbald, and the blue point Siamese cat. The Siamese cat comes in two distinct variations: traditional, with an apple-shaped head and a slightly chubby body; or the modern Siamese, which are very skinny and have a wedge-shaped head. The long-haired Siamese is recognized internationally as a Balinese cat.\n\n","image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f6\/Siamese_Cat_p.jpg"},{"breed":"Siberian cat","summary":"The Siberian is a landrace variety of domestic cat, present in Russia for centuries, and more recently developed as a formal breed, with standards promulgated since the late 1980s.They vary from medium to medium-large in size. A longer name of the formal breed is Siberian Forest Cat, but it is usually referred to as the Siberian or the Siberian cat. Another name for the formal breed is the Moscow Semi-Longhair. The cat is an ancient breed that is now believed to be ancestral to all modern long-haired cats. The cat has similarities with the Norwegian forest cat, to which it is likely closely related. It is a natural breed of Siberia and the national cat of Russia. While it began as a landrace, it is selectively bred and pedigreed today in at least seven major cat fancier and breeder organisations. The colorpoint variant of the breed is called the Neva Masquerade by some registries, including F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale F\u00e9line (FIF\u00e9).\nThere are claims that it is hypoallergenic and produces less Fel d1 than other cat breeds.","image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/0d\/Siberian_Forest_Cat.jpg"},{"breed":"Singapura cat","summary":"The Singapura is one of the smallest breeds of cats, noted for its large eyes and ears, brown ticked coat and blunt tail. Reportedly established from three \"drain cats\" imported from Singapore in the 1970s, it was later revealed that the cats were originally sent to Singapore from the US before they were exported back to the US. Investigations by the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) concluded no wrongdoing and the Singapura kept its status as a natural breed.","image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/3b\/Singapura_Cats.jpg"},{"breed":"Snowshoe cat","summary":"The Snowshoe is a breed of cat originating in the United States of America in the 1960s. Snowshoes were first produced in Philadelphia when a Siamese breeder's cat gave birth to three kittens with white feet. The breeder, Dorothy Hinds-Daugherty, then began a breeding program to produce what were originally called \"Silver Laces\", crossing the strangely marked Siamese cats with bi-color American Shorthair cats and other breeds. When Hinds-Daugherty left the program, Vikki Olander began working with the cats and recruited new breeders, as well as worked towards full recognition within cat associations. Despite having existed for 45 years, Snowshoes are rare due to the difficulty of reproducing the correct coat markings. The marks are based on recessive genes for color points and on the co-dominant but variably-expressed piebald pattern gene, making it difficult to predict the appearance of offspring.\nThe coat coloration recognized by registries and associations is point coloration, and it comes in a variety of colors, though some organizations do not recognize certain colors. Snowshoe cats have an affectionate and docile disposition. Due to this, they do not do well under circumstances where they are left alone for long periods of time. Snowshoes are also very vocal, though their voices are not as loud as the Siamese, a cat found in their breed heritage. They are noted as being very intelligent and have the ability to learn tricks and open doors. These cats also enjoy water, and may swim.\n\n","image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/26\/Snowshoe_Siamese_Kitten.jpg"},{"breed":"Sokoke","summary":"The Sokoke (or Sokoke Forest Cat in long form, and formerly the African Shorthair) is natural breed of domestic cat, developed and standardised, beginning in the late 1970s, from the feral khadzonzo landrace of eastern, coastal Kenya. The Sokoke is recognized by four major cat pedigree registry organizations as a standardised cat breed. It is named after the Arabuko Sokoke National Forest, the environment from which the foundation stock was obtained, for breed development primarily in Denmark and the United States.  The cat is long-legged, with short, coarse hair, and typically a tabby coat, though specific lineages have produced different appearances. Although once rumored to be a domestic \u00d7 wildcat hybrid, genetic study has not borne out this belief. Another idea, that the variety is unusually ancient, remains unproven either way.

Hairlessness in cats is a naturally occurring genetic mutation; however, the Sphynx cat, as a breed, was developed through selective breeding, starting in the 1960s. The skin should have the texture of chamois, as it has fine hairs, or they may be completely hairless. Whiskers may be present, either whole or broken, or may be totally absent. They also have a narrow, long head, and webbed feet. Their skin is the color that their fur would be, and all the usual cat markings (solid, point, van, tabby, tortie, etc.) may be found on the Sphynx cat's skin. Because they have no coat, they lose more body heat than coated cats. This makes them warm to the touch and causes them to seek out sources of heat.","image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/e\/e8\/Sphinx2_July_2006.jpg"},{"breed":"Suphalak","summary":"The Suphalak (Thai: \u0e41\u0e21\u0e27\u0e28\u0e38\u0e20\u0e25\u0e31\u0e01\u0e29\u0e13\u0e4c, \u0e41\u0e21\u0e27\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e41\u0e14\u0e07, RTGS: Suphalak, Thong Daeng) is a solid reddish-brown copper colored short-haired breed of cat originating in Thailand.

The breed is rare, and is distinguished by the Van pattern (named for the breed), where the colour is restricted to the head and the tail, and the rest of the cat is white; this is due to the expression of the piebald white spotting gene, a type of partial leucism.  A Turkish Van may have blue or amber eyes, or be odd-eyed (having one eye of each colour). The breed has been claimed to be descended from the landrace of usually all-white Van cats (Turkish: Van kedisi), mostly found near Lake Van, though one of the two original breeders' own writings indicate clearly that none of the breed's foundation cats came from the Van area, which has historically been in Armenia.Then called the Turkish Cat, the breed was first recognised as such by a breeder\/fancier organisation, the UK-based Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF), in 1969.  It was later renamed \"Turkish Van\" to better distinguish it from the Turkish Angora breed.  The term \"Turkish Vankedisi\" is used by some organisations as a name for all-white specimens of the formal Turkish Van breed, nomenclature easily confused with the Van kedisi landrace cats, which are also often all-white.\n\n","image":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4c\/Push_van_cat.jpg"},{"breed":"Ukrainian Levkoy","summary":"The Ukrainian Levkoy (Ukrainian: \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043b\u0435\u0432\u043a\u043e\u0439) is a cat breed of distinct appearance, having inward-folding ears and little to no hair.
