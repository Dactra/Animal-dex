The breed is selectively bred for its unique features in the cold mountains of Afghanistan. Its local name is Tāžī Spay (Pashto: تاژي سپی‎) or Sag-e Tāzī (Dari Persian: سگ تازی). Other names for this breed areTāzī, Balkh Hound, Baluchi Hound, Barakzai Hound, Shalgar Hound, Kabul Hound, Galanday Hound or sometimes incorrectly African Hound.

It is a working dog following the nomads, protecting caravans and flocks of sheep, goats, camels and other livestock from wolves, big cats and thieves. It is sometimes known as just a local variant of the Central Asian Shepherd Dog and its status as a distinct breed is disputable.\n",

      "Because the dog is intricately associated with nomad life in remote and rugged regions where Western breeding techniques are not used, it is difficult to identify a \"true\" Kuchi type dog.  Warfare and general unrest in the region has also affected the Kuchi people, of whom many have settled around cities, creating ample opportunity for the Kuchi to interbreed with other dogs. There is no organizing body for dogs in Afghanistan and some Kuchi dogs have been exported to Europe.\n",

Inevitably these mountain dogs filtered through to the wider population, and the original variety dwindled in its pure form, though a rare breed, the \"Cane Garouf\" or \"Patua\", found in the part of the Alps formerly inhabited by the Alpine Mastiff, may also descend from the extinct breed.\n",

Dogs very similar to these, including the Cirneco dell'Etna and Pharaoh Hound, have been bred in much of the Mediterranean basin since ancient times. Despite the widespread belief that the podencos were introduced into Spain some 3,000 years ago by the Phoenicians, recent genetic studies have concluded that these dogs actually have a close genetic relationship with other European hunting dogs and are no more \"primitive\" than the others.\n",

This breed is a medium-sized, short-coated dog that occurs in two main colour forms. It has either brown or black hair distributed fairly evenly through a white coat, which gives the appearance of a \"red\" or \"blue\" dog.\n",

It responds well to structured training, particularly if it is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.\n",

Both dingoes and Basenji lack a distinctive odor, and are prone to howls, yodels, and other vocalizations over the characteristic bark of modern dog breeds. One theory holds that the latter trait is the result of selecting against dogs that frequently bark—in the traditional Central African context—because barking could lead enemies to humans' forest encampments. While dogs that resemble the Basenji in some respects are commonplace over much of Africa, the breed's original foundation stock came from the old growth forest regions of the Congo Basin, where its structure and type were fixed by adaptation to its habitat, as well as use (primarily net hunting in extremely dense old-growth forest vegetation).\n",

Like the Chien de Saint-Hubert it was a scenthound, and formed part of the royal packs of France, which were composed, from about 1250 till 1470, exclusively of hounds of this type. According to King Charles IX, (1550–1574) they supposedly were introduced to France through Saint Louis (i.e. King Louis IX, 1226–1270), who had encountered these hounds while a prisoner during the Crusades, and subsequently received some as a gift. Old writers on hunting liked to ascribe an ancient and remote origin to their hounds, and these were claimed to be originally from Tartary. \n",

      "Jacques du Fouilloux, in the 16th century, says they were common, and describes them as 'gris' (grey) on the back with forequarters and legs tan or red, some having near black hair on the back. They were roughhaired, and were ancestors of the  modern French rough-coated Griffon breeds. However the rough coats were not mentioned by Charles IX or du Fouilloux, and it has been suggested they were acquired later through interbreeding with indigenous French hounds.  They were headstrong, wide casting hounds, inclined to change or overshoot, but determined in their pursuit of a quarry to the death. However, by the nineteenth century, like the St Hubert, they had become virtually impossible to find, because of mixed breeding and the effect of the Revolution on French hunting.George Turberville   translated du Fouilloux' book on hunting into English, and used the term 'Dun hound' to translate 'Chien-gris'. We may presume he did not translate it literally as 'grey-hound' to avoid confusion. One finds the term 'dun-hound' in some subsequent writing in English, suggesting that the kind also existed in Britain, and it has been supposed that these 'dun-hounds' went into the make up of the Bloodhound, accounting for the 'badgering' of the hair in the saddles of some bloodhounds.  However, Turberville did not make it very clear that his book was a translation, and it is highly possible that people mistakenly believed his work was about English hunting. Early references to the dun-hound may simply come from people relying, like Nicolas Cox, on Turberville, [1] and it is quite possible that the dun hound was never a significant animal in British hunting.\n",

      "The dingo is a dog that is native to Australia. The species name is debated: it is variously called Canis familiaris, Canis familiaris dingo,  Canis lupus dingo, or Canis dingo. It is either a purebred, if breeding only in the wild, or a hybrid of a dingo and a domesticated dog. It is a medium-sized canid that possesses a lean, hardy body adapted for speed, agility, and stamina. The dingo's three main coat colours are: light ginger or tan, black and tan, or creamy white. The skull, the widest part of the dingo, is wedge-shaped and large in proportion to the body. It differs from that of the domestic dog by its larger palatal width, longer rostrum, shorter skull height, and wider sagittal crest.The earliest known dingo fossil, found in Western Australia, dates to 3,450 years ago, which led to the presumption that dingoes came to Australia with seafarers prior to that time. Dingo morphology has not changed over the past 3,500 years: this suggests that no artificial selection has been applied over this period.The dingo is closely related to the New Guinea singing dog: their lineage split early from the lineage that led to today's domestic dogs, and can be traced back through the Malay Archipelago to Asia. A recent genetic study shows that the lineage of those dingoes found today in the northwestern part of the Australian continent split from the lineage of the New Guinea singing dog and southeastern dingo 6,300 BC, followed by a split between the New Guinea singing dog lineage from the southeastern dingo lineage 5,800 BC. The study proposes that two dingo migrations occurred when sea levels were lower and Australia and New Guinea formed one landmass named Sahul that existed until 6,500–8,000 years ago. Seafarers from south-west Sulawesi in modern-day Indonesia may have brought the dingo to northern Australia.The dingo's habitat covers most of Australia, but they are completely absent in the southwest, a strip on the eastern coast, and an area on the southwest coast (see map). Dingos prey on mammals up to the size of the large red kangaroo, in addition to birds, reptiles, fish, crabs, frogs, insects, and seeds. The dingo's competitors include the native quoll, the introduced European red fox and the feral cat. A dingo pack usually consists of a mated pair, their offspring from the current year, and sometimes offspring from the previous year.The first British colonists who settled at Port Jackson in 1788 recorded dingoes living with indigenous Australians. When livestock farming began expanding across Australia in the early 19th century, dingos began preying on sheep and cattle. Numerous population-control measures have been implemented since then, with only limited success. The dingo is recognised as a native animal under the laws of all Australian jurisdictions. It is listed as a \"vulnerable species\" on the IUCN Red List due to declining numbers.\n",

The Dobermann has a long muzzle. It stands on its pads and is not usually heavy-footed. Ideally, they have an even and graceful gait. Traditionally, the ears are cropped and posted and the tail is docked. However, in some countries, it is illegal to do so.

In the current breed standard the tail is docked at approximately 40% of its length before it curves. In competition she is penalized if the tail is curved either up or down while the dog is moving.  When the GSP is in classic point stance, the tail should be held straight out from the body, forming a line with the pointing head and body. Like all German pointers, GSPs have webbed feet.

The Canadian Kennel Club voted to fully recognize Glens in 2017 after the breed spent years on the Miscellaneous list; approval by Agriculture Canada is pending.\n",

After the conflict, many of these soldiers settled in the Wicklow area. They brought with them their low-slung hounds, which they bred with the local terrier stock, eventually developing a distinctive breed that became known as the Glen of Imaal Terrier.\n",
      "Glens were originally used for eradicating other animals such as rat, fox, badger, and otter, and also as a general-purpose farm dog for herding and family companionship. Unlike many other terriers, they are \"strong dogs\" rather than \"sounders\"—they were bred to work mute to ground, going silently into dens after their quarry rather than barking at it to alert their handlers. In hunting trials, which used to be required by many kennel clubs for championships, Glens were disqualified if they sounded at the quarry. For this reason, today they are among the quietest terriers.\n",
      "According to Irish lore, Glen of Imaal Terriers were also used as turnspit dogs to turn meat over fires for cooking. Evidence for this is scarce, and engravings of such dogs from the 19th century do not bear much resemblance to today's Glen. It is, however, repeated in many descriptions of the breed and often used in color commentary by dog show announcers.\n",

Today, the Glen of Imaal Terrier is still one of the rarest breeds of dog (in the US, living registered animals number in the hundreds) and the least-known Irish terrier breed.

Additionally, they are prized as sporting and hunting dogs.A few kennels breeding their ancestors, the St. John's water dog, were in England. At the same time, a combination of the sheep protection policy in Newfoundland and the rabies quarantine in the United Kingdom led to the gradual demise of the St. John's water dog in Canada.In the 1830s, the 10th Earl of Home and his nephews the 5th Duke of Buccleuch and Lord John Scott, had imported progenitors of the breed from Newfoundland to Europe for use as gundogs. Another early advocate of these Newfoundland dogs, or Labrador Retrievers as they later became known, was the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury who bred them for their expertise in waterfowling.During the 1880s, the 3rd Earl of Malmesbury, the 6th Duke of Buccleuch and the 12th Earl of Home collaborated to develop and establish the modern Labrador breed. The dogs Buccleuch Avon and Buccleuch Ned, given by Malmesbury to Buccleuch, were mated with bitches carrying blood from those originally imported by the 5th Duke and the 10th Earl of Home.

Once a popular breed in Lithuania, the population decreased to 78 individuals after World War II. Thanks to several enthusiasts, the hound was revived, standardized, and the number of registered and documented dogs reached around 350 in 1987.

It has been used for centuries by Italian shepherds to guard sheep from wolves. The literal English translation of the name is \"The dog of the shepherds of the Maremma and Abruzzese region\". The English name of the breed derives from that of the Maremma marshlands, where, until recently, shepherds, dogs and hundreds of thousands of sheep over-wintered, and where the breed is today abundant although sheep-farming has decreased substantially.  The breed is widely employed in Abruzzo, where sheep herding remains vital to the rural economy and the wolf remains an active and protected predator. Similar breeds include the Pyrenean Mountain Dog, the Kuvasz of Hungary, the Tatra of Poland, the Cuvac of Slovakia and the Šarplaninac (although not white), with all of which it may share a common ancestor; and the Akbash Dog of Turkey.\n",

The exact date of its extinction is not known; it is likely that it was gradually interbred with other breeds, particularly the modern Beagle, until the genuine North Country Beagle bloodline ceased to exist.\n",
      "The origins of the North Country Beagle are equally unclear. Most writers suggest that it was developed from the Talbot, whose origins are also uncertain, but which some have claimed originated in Normandy. The Talbot was a predominantly white, slow, deep-throated, scent hound. At some point the Talbots were crossed with Greyhounds to give them an extra turn of speed, but they remained comparatively slow dogs that relied more on their nose than speed in the chase.The North Country Beagle was a large, bony hound with a square head, and long trailing ears. Chiefly bred in Yorkshire, it was common in the north of England, but below the River Trent the similar Southern Hound was more abundant. The North Country Beagle was a faster dog; in The British Encyclopedia of 1809, William Nicholson says that the North Country Beagle was kept by the \"dashing class of sportsman\" because it could \"run down a brace [of hare] before dinner\", but although a good scent hound, was probably lacking in this ability when compared to the delicate nose of the Southern Hound. The writer and poet Gervase Markham, who wrote a number of books on animal husbandry in the early 17th century described the North Country Beagle as having:\n",
      "\n",
      "...a head more slender, with a longer nose, ears and flews more shallow, back broad, belly gaunt, joints long, tail small, and his general form more slender and greyhound-like...\n",
      "In his The Dog, in Health and Disease in 1859, \"Stonehenge\" (the pen name of John Henry Walsh, later editor of The Field) says the two breeds could be differentiated by the large dewlap possessed by the Southern Hound. The Southern Hound seems to have also had a deeper more melodious voice; Markham says the North Country Beagle had \"only a little shrill sweetness\" and lacked depth of tone. How far the Talbot, Northern Hound and Southern Hound were intermixed by the 19th century is impossible to ascertain: while acknowledging that they had once existed as separate breeds, Stonehenge had never seen pure-bred varieties and classified the three breeds together.Both the North Country Beagle and Southern Hound seem to have fallen out of favour during the 18th century as the fashion for less time consuming hunts led to the development of the faster Foxhound. The North Country Beagle may have formed part of the packs kept by southern farmers for rabbit-hunting that would eventually become the nucleus for the modern Beagle breed. Stonehenge says that packs of hounds that resembled the description of the North Country Beagle still existed in Wales, Devon, Yorkshire and Sussex during the 19th century, but he was doubtful as to how far any of these packs truly represented any of the three early hound breeds.Aside from the Beagle other modern hound breeds are believed to have North Country Beagle blood: Harriers and Foxhounds among others. Coonhounds and Bloodhounds are likely to have had more influence from the Southern Hound and Talbot lines, as they are excellent trackers but not as swift as other hound breeds.\n",

It is known for its courage in tracking and hunting moose  (or elk) and other large game, such as bears or wolves. The Norwegian Elkhound was first presented at a dog exhibition in Norway in 1877.\n",
      "The AKC breed name \"Norwegian Elkhound\" is a direct translation from its original Norwegian name Norsk elghund, meaning \"Norwegian moose dog.\" The breed's object in the hunt is to independently track down and hold the moose at bay—jumping in and out toward the moose, distracting its attention, while signaling to the hunters by barking very loudly—until the hunter who follows the sound can arrive to shoot it. The dog will only bark while the moose is stationary, but it can also slowly drive the moose towards shooters lying in wait. The Norwegian Elkhound is also used on a leash. In this mode of hunting, the dog leads the hunter in the direction of the moose while keeping quiet.\n",

      "The Old Croatian Sighthound, regionally known as the hrti, is a breed of dog from Croatia. Originally developed as a sighthound, the greyhound-like breed was almost exterminated during Croatia's time as part of Yugoslavia; however, its continued existence was confirmed in December 2008.This recent (Bauer & Lemo, December 2008) report containing a record of a preserved nucleus of a regional Old World sighthound, the hrt, or Old Croatian sighthound, is a notable cynological and veterinary contribution to sighthound history. It is one more confirmation of the mechanism behind the extinction of sighthound varieties, where the loss of \"aristocratic\", landed hunting rights (pursued mainly by horse, and hound) gave place to \"universal\", licensed hunting rights (pursued mainly on foot, by gun) which tended to literally outlaw sighthounds. Sighthounds, which by definition require large open tracts of land, became an object of suspected poaching, and were often actively persecuted. Consequently the regional and national varieties, which for ages had been prolific across Europe, were eradicated or allowed to die out. The Chort, Magyar Agar and Chart, for example escaped this fate, the Frisian sighthound did not. Where national breed and Kennel Clubs actively encouraged sighthound studbooks, and where a strong coursing culture was present sighthounds such as the Galgo survived. In some cases, as with the latter, and as Bauer and Lemo report in connection with the hrt, regional sighthound identity could be compromised by crosses to Greyhounds or other breeds.\n",

Pandikona is located near Kurnool district in Andhra Pradesh. The area is considered dangerous to outsiders because of warring factions and political differences. This highly territorial breed is used to guard villages, property and livestock and to hunt any available game. Their territorial nature and sharp tempers often result in fights with neighboring dogs that trespass onto its territory. Since Pandikona is a small village with overlapping property boundaries and most homes has 2 to 3 dogs, it is quite natural for dogs to posture and get into occasional squabbles over borders. Most of the squabbles end in one dog retreating and no serious injuries. Villagers do not normally intercede in the dogs territorial battles. These intelligent and independent dog are never chained but roam freely among the village and do not take directions from their owners. They are normally within the vicinity of their property and take their guarding duties seriously. When bored or satisfied with the security of their owners home the dogs will go to the owners farm and continue guarding duties. Ideally suited for guarding or hunting duties the Pandikona is a fierce protector that is tolerant of errant children and young strays but are deadly serious with adults. The Pandikona will normally warn the intruder to stay away but the warning is fleeting and the impending attack carried out swiftly and with great intensity. Adult Pandikona dogs are focused and confident in their abilities to defend and will exercise some judgment when confronted with a young person or juvenile animal. Their hunting function is performed in the traditional way with weapons that have been used for generations. Normally done with a spear or \"ballem\" which is a sharp metal end affixed to a stick. Hunting in this way exposes the hunter and the dogs to grave danger from boars and other animals. The dogs hunt in packs with a leaders established by pack order and all territorial disagreements are forgotten during the hunt. Typically the leader has the best nose and bite and goes in hunt for the boar with the pack following at a discrete distance. It is said that the pack has a complex communication system which enables the leader to warn the pack of dangers such as snakes, scorpions and if it has found the quarry. If the prey is very large the leader will take the first bite and bring the prey down. If the prey is not very challenging the leader will allow the junior leader to take the first bite and bring the quarry down with the other joining in the kill. \n",

Dogs quite similar to the Pharaoh Hound and other possible Tesem descended dog breeds are found scattered around the Mediterranean where the Phoenicians traded, namely the Cirneco dell'Etna, Podenco Ibicenco, Podenco Canario, Podenco andaluz and the Portuguese Podengo.

      "Rache , also spelled racch, rach, and ratch, from Old English ræcc, linked to Old Norse rakkí, is an obsolete name for a type of hunting dog used in Britain in the Middle Ages. It was a scenthound used in a pack to run down and kill game, or bring it to bay. The word appears before the Norman Conquest. It was sometimes confused with 'brache', (also 'bratchet') which is a French derived word for a female scent hound.In medieval hunting in England and Northern Europe, pursuit of the hart or wild boar involved using a 'limer' or 'lyam hound' (a hound handled on a leash or 'lyam') to trace the animal from its footprints or droppings to where it was browsing or lying up. This became known as 'harbouring' the animal. When this had been done, the huntsman reported back to his lord, who then brought the pack of raches to chase it down on its hot scent when it had been unharboured, 'rowsed' or 'upreared'. Sometimes, pairs of raches were held at strategic points along where the quarry was expected to run, to be uncoupled when the huntsman blew the signal, or when the quarry was seen to come close. The Bloodhound was typically used as a limer, and the raches were normally smaller hounds. A lord's pack would include one or two limers to about twenty or more raches.\n",
      "\n",
      "A king or lord would want to hunt a great stag, a 'hart of ten', or 'warrantable' stag, or a powerful boar, partly for the extra fat it carried when in prime condition in the hunting season, but mostly for kudos.\n",
      "In Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Bloodhounds announce the presence of a great boar hiding in a thicket, which then rushes out and plays havoc among the raches of the knight's pack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all game was hunted using the leashhound. Dame Juliana Berners, writing in The Book of Saint Albans (1486) writes (translation): \n",
      "'My dear sons, I will now teach each one of you how many kinds of beasts must be upreared with the limer in wood or in fields - both the hart and the buck and the boar so wild. All other animals which are hunted must be sought and found with free-running raches (\"ratches so fre\").'\n",
      "\n",
      "Other writers might include the hare, bear, or wolf among animals to be harboured with the limer, but clearly raches could be hunted simply as a pack, as in modern hunting, if chasing 'lesser' game.\n",
      "After c. 1530 the term 'rache' was hardly used in England, 'running hound' (tr. of chien courant), or mostly just 'hound', being preferred, but the term was still used for a while in Scotland, where the Bloodhound was called the sleuth hound.  Hector Boece (1536) describes the rache in Scotland as a versatile scenthound, able to find flesh, fowl, or even fish among the rocks, by smelling. His translator, Bellenden, says that it is not a large as the sleuth hound. The picture below, though it did not appear in Boece's original, was first published to illustrate his account when it was summarised in Conrad Gessner's Historiae Animalium (Zurich 1554, in Latin).\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously raches must have far outnumbered Bloodhounds in the medieval dog population, and may have been quite disparate, depending on the sort of game they were used to hunt. In the picture above from Les Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry (1410) the raches are not all of the same breed. In Britain, they may have included the now-extinct North Country Beagle and Southern Hound. As styles of hunting changed, and the Bloodhound fell out of use, packs were normally employed on their own to hunt all quarry. Though their name became obsolete, raches must have continued in this use. We may assume that it was from them, rather than the Bloodhound, that the various breeds of pack hounds such as the English Foxhound, Harrier, Beagle and English Staghound were developed. It is apparent that in the 16th and 17th centuries there was a good deal of regional variation in size and type of scenthound, from which the prospective Master of Hounds could mix and match to form his pack.\n",

Despite its seemingly cumbersome proportions, it was fast and flexible enough to chase off wolves and other such predators that threatened its sheep. It wore a thick, taffy colored double-coat that protected it from both the harsh weather and the savage wildlife. Aside from its physical prowess, this mountain dog also had exceptional intellect. It was so wise and capable (legend says) that it could keep itself and its flock alive and well for months on end with no human help.The breed is related to on some level, and may be synonymous with, the Yellow Russian Retriever, which measured 28 inches (71 cm) and 90 pounds (41 kg).

This hard-working small dog is intelligent, vocal, excitable and willing to please. They are incredibly loyal to their owners to the point where they are often referred to as \"shadows\" due to their attachment to family. This breed was formally recognized by The Kennel Club (UK) in 1909.Like the Shetland pony, Shetland Cattle and the Shetland sheep, the Shetland Sheepdog is a hardy but diminutive breed developed to thrive amidst the harsh and meagre conditions of its native islands.  While the Sheltie still excels at herding, today it is often raised as a farm dog and/or family pet.The Sheltie's origins are obscure, but it is not a direct descendant of the Rough Collie, which it largely resembles. Rather, the Sheltie is a descendant of small specimens of the Scottish Collie and the King Charles Spaniel. They were originally a small mixed-breed dog, often only about 8 to 12 inches in height at the shoulder, and it is thought that the original Shetland herding dogs were of the Spitz type, and were crossed with Collies from mainland Britain. In the early 20th century,  James Loggie added a small Rough Collie to the breeding stock, and helped establish the breed that would become the modern Shetland Sheepdog.\n",

Staffies first arrived in North America in the mid to late 1880s but it was not until 1974 that AKC accepted the Staffordshire Bull Terrier into their purebred registry.\n",

      "The Standard Schnauzer (Mittelschnauzer) is a dog breed that originated in Germany from at least 14th-15th century, of Schnauzer breed type and progenitor of the Giant Schnauzer and Miniature Schnauzer. Initially it was called Wire-Haired Pinscher, while Schnauzer was adopted in 1879. The literal translation is \"snouter\" from the German word for \"snout\" and means colloquially \"moustache\", or \"whiskered snout\", because of the dog's distinctively bearded snout.Generally classified as a working or utility dog, this versatile breed is robust, squarely built, medium-sized dog with aristocratic bearing. It has been claimed that it was a popular subject of painters Sir Joshua Reynolds, Albrecht Dürer and Rembrandt, but actual proof remains elusive. Standard Schnauzers are either salt-and-pepper or black in color, and are known for exhibiting many of the \"ideal\" traits of any breed. These include high intelligence, agility, alertness, reliability, strength, and endurance. This breed of dog has been very popular in Europe, specifically Germany, where it originated. The breed was first exhibited at a show in Hanover in 1879, and since then has taken top honors in many shows, including the prestigious \"Best in Show\" at Westminster Kennel Club\" in the United States in 1997.\n",

Much diversity exists in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed, and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha, and Tenterfield Terrier. The Rat Terrier's background is said to stem from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working-class immigrants. Since the breed was a farm, hunting, and utility dog, little to no planned breeding was used  other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other to produce the desired work ethic in the dog. The Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit Dog, and Wry-legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry.  These early ratting terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle crossbred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs. Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell. and a very high intellect.

They are scent hounds that descended from the Celtic Hounds in the late 1800s, mainly for their hunting skills. They are hardworking, passionate, and independent dogs not known for their size, but rather their intelligence. For that reason, hunters can regularly use these dogs to catch their prey, wounded or otherwise. Their ability to stretch over long distances, on rough hot or cold terrain for their prey is also another perk of keeping this dog by your side. Hunters do have to worry about injuries to their dog, however, along with the common injuries that these dogs obtain throughout their life, like hip dysplasia or ear infections. Barring any injuries, these dogs tend to live an energetic life for about 12-14 years, and tend to be an overall healthy and robust dog.\n",

      "The Welsh Hillman was thought to have been descended from ancient Welsh herding dogs. It was possibly the oldest Welsh sheepdog, and may have been the descendant of the old gellgi or \"Welsh wolfhounds\" used around 1,000 years ago. Some sources, without any obvious evidence, suggest it was crossbred with similar dogs seen in North Africa.It was a large but rangy dog, up to around 25 inches in height, and described as \"fast and fearless\", with an appearance not unlike a lighter-built German Shepherd. The ears were pricked. The coat was usually of a light fawn, sandy or red-gold colour with a black saddle, white chest, white on the legs and tip of the tail and a blaze on the face. Blue merle dogs were also occasionally seen.\n",

Some people incorrectly call a Welsh Sheepdog a Welsh Collie - usually 'Welsh Collie' is used for a cross between a Welsh Sheepdog and a Border Collie, who is often a milder dog and easier to manage than the pure breed.\n",
      "Like other types of working dog, Welsh Sheepdogs are normally bred for their herding abilities rather than appearance, and so they are generally somewhat variable in build, colour and size.  Welsh Sheepdogs are of collie type, usually black-and-white, red-and-white or tricolour, and merle markings may occur over any of these combinations.  The coat may be short or fairly long, and the ears are pricked, but usually folded at the tip.  They are longer in leg, broader in chest and wider in muzzle than the Border Collie. They are extremely active and intelligent, and therefore need much exercise and mental stimulation, if they are to be kept as pets.\n",
      "Over many decades the Welsh Sheepdog has largely been replaced for working sheep in Wales by the Border Collie, a standardised breed. However, in more recent years, efforts have been made to maintain the indigenous Welsh Sheepdog as a distinct variety.\n",
      "Welsh Sheepdogs are usually of loose-eyed action, not fixing the stock with their gaze like the strong-eyed Border Collie.  They are able to work independently without necessarily being under direct human control.  Welsh Sheepdogs are most often used for herding sheep, but also readily work cattle, goats, and even horses and pigs.

The breed's coat only comes in a single colour combination of white with red markings, usually in a piebald pattern. Loyal and affectionate, they can become very attached to family members and are wary of strangers. Health conditions are limited to those common among many breeds of dog, although they are affected more than average by hip dysplasia and some eye conditions.

In Russian language, the term Laika originated from the word layat that means to bark. The word Laika simply means barker.

Whippets also participate in dog sports such as lure coursing, agility, and flyball. The name is derived from an early 17th-century word, now obsolete, meaning \"to move briskly\".There has been continuity in describing Greyhound-types of different sizes: large, medium and small, as recorded in hunting manuals and works on natural history from the Middle Ages. Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York confirmed in his early 15th century translation and additions to the original late 14th century French Livre_de_chasse the advantage of maintaining the great, the middle, and the small size of greyhound for different sorts of game.[1]\n",
